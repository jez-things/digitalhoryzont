1. Introduction

----
  1.1. Preface
   Internet of things: set of phyton scripts for collecting data from raspberry Pi by external sensors 
   (e.g. temperature, humidity, light) and bitcoin mining hardware, sending to munin on external box. 
   ...

2. Installation 

  2.1. Hardware Requirements
   Among several ways to install 
   Raspberry Pi, solderless board, 2x 4k7 resistors, DHT11, DS18B20.
  2.2. Software Requirements
   Each script has different dependencies. 
    readtemp.py - python2-serial python2-daemon
                  It's supported on python2.x tested at the moment only on python2.7

      
  2.3. Configuration

  2.3.1. munin/bitcurex.py
	bitcurex.pl python script is a munin script used for drawing munin charts of BTC
   currency from well-known polish bitcoin stock. No configuration provided at the moment.

  2.3.2. munin/polmine
	polmine - 

  2.3.3. munin/cgminer
	cgminer is a python script which draws munin charts of cgminer and tools which
  support JSON API of cgminer or tools derived from cgminer e.g. bfgminer. There are
  two configuration options available: rpc_port and rpc_host. There's no need to
  configure these options in munin-node.conf in that case default values are:

  rpc_port 4028
  rpc_host 127.0.0.1

  script itself supports (except standard ones) additional command line options: test
  When cgminer is run with a test option it connects to given rpc_host on a given port
  and prints all variables available.

  2.3.4. readtemp.py
	readtemp is a python script which runs on python 2.x version 3.x is not supported 
  at the moment. Application reads data in form variable=value <space> ...
  Then it sends all collected data to thingspeak web service via HTTP.
  It accepts following command line arguments:
     -d|--debug       Activates debugging mode.
     -A|--apikey      API key for thingspeak.
     -S|--serial_port path to serial device.
     -h|--help        Show usage messaga.

  2.3.5. munin/DHT11
	DHT11 is a python script used for drawing munin charts of humidity percentage from
   DHT11 sensor connected to raspberryPi (for details inspect fritzing sketch included in
   git repository and distribution pack).  The sensor itself can read also temperature,
   however so far it is not supported. Script depends on DHT11 driver developed by
   adafruit and available in git repository. Also script has to be runned by root (as munin does)
   or at least with suid. To run script as root following munin configuration
   has to be added in /etc/munin/munin-node.conf file:

   [DHT11]
   user root 
   
  2.3.6. munin/lightlevel
  2.3.7. munin/noise
  2.3.8. munin/environmental



3. Development information
  	After this chapter you're supposed to be fluent with project development environment its
  cycle and milestones. Also you're going to be familiar with our needs and direction where it goes.

  3.1. Introduction
	Project is under a constant development both (even) from conceptual part and implementation.
  Software disribution is splitted into two parts: mining scripts and monitoring of environment which
  sometimes corresponts in some subtle aspects. The biggest and more complex part of the software pack
  is weather/environment monitoring.

  3.2. Known bugs
   3.2.1. Reading 1byte from serial (readtemp.py)
         In case of connecting arduino for sensors script readtemp.py reads
         1byte in from serial making too much of overload in communication making the
         whole script "stressing" CPU time.  The possible solution is
